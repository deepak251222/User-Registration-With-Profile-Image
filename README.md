5.Associate Profile Image with User: Once the image is stored, save the profile image file name or file path in the profileImage field of the user entity.

6.Save User to the Database: Use a repository or service class to save the user entity to the database. Ensure that the User entity is properly mapped and configured with an appropriate database schema.

7.Test the User Registration: Run your Spring Boot application and access the user registration form. Fill in the required details and select a profile image. Submit the form and verify that the user and the associated profile image are saved successfully.
